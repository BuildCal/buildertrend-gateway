# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project does not yet follow SemVer releases (pre-alpha).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Captured `bills.create` + `bills.update` (Save draft) + `bills.attach`
  from the 2 Sep 2026 sandbox pass: GET `defaultinfo` → POST `/api/v1/bills`
  (status 9, amounts 0) → PUT save-draft (exclusive amounts,
  `saveAsDraft: true`) → optional PDF via `tempFile` + `EntityDocs`
  (`documentType` 58). One attach. Not `ocr-upload`. Not Ready-for-Payment.
- Read helpers `bills.defaults` and `bills.availablePurchaseOrders`.
  `bills.linkPurchaseOrder` stays `not_captured` until GetBillMapping fires.
- Buildertrend Gateway (`apps/gateway`): one MCP + HTTP `/v1` surface for
  in-scope verbs. Writes default to `dry_run`. Send/pay/notify stay locked.
- Captured variation draft + line add/update/delete with GST dummy-line
  recompute (1/11 of owner price; cost code from Search).
- Capture harness (Playwright, dedicated profile) and Slice C discovery list
  for uncaptured writes (`not_captured` instead of guessed URLs).
- Mirror tables / `bt_sync_state` / `bt_command_log` plus `sync.pull`.
- Sidecar `POST /internal/bt-request` with merge-patch content-type and a
  send-path denylist.
- HTTP `/v1` fails closed without `BT_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. Per-verb MCP/HTTP Zod
  schemas. GST cost-code search (no
  tenant fallback). Capture harness refuses the human Chrome profile.
- MIT license, contributing guide, code of conduct, and security policy
- GitHub issue and pull request templates
- Complete environment variable examples (including optional Claude / Supabase)
- Admin seed script wired as `pnpm db:seed`

### Changed

- Owner-invoice `invoices.saveDraft` and `invoices.addLines` captured 4 Sep 2026
  via `PUT /apix/v3/Invoices/save-invoice` with `application/merge-patch+json`.
  `addLines` uses the same Save with `lineItems` / `ownerInvoiceLineItems`;
  related picker is `GET /api/LineItems/EntityLineItemsToInvoice`. Gateway
  forces `notifyOwner` / `createInvoiceChkbox` false and `status` Draft.
  Never Send. An earlier 3 Sep dedicated-profile attempt redirected to Auth0
  (`auth_required`) and fired no invoice write.

- Bill create payload now matches the 2 Sep 2026 capture (`status` 9,
  `saveDraftToJob` false, `purchaseOrderId` -1, amounts on PUT). The old
  stub guessed `status` 0 / `saveDraftToJob` true / `isCreateNewFromPO`
  from a non-null PO id.
- README rewritten for a public, self-hosted audience (unofficial Buildertrend disclaimer)
- Stripped tenant/business-specific names, jobs, and ids. Builder id comes
  from GlobalInfo. GST cost code comes from Search, not a hard-coded default.
- PostgresStore INSERT now sets `id` on `bt_command_log` and `bt_sync_state`.
- SidecarAdapter unwraps FastAPI `detail` so 403 `send_disabled` is not
  mapped to `auth_required`.
- Removed leftover tenant-specific branding and hardcoded builder IDs from examples
- Webhook authentication now uses a timing-safe comparison and fails closed if the secret is unset
- Invalid bill list `status` query params now return HTTP 400 instead of crashing (name clash with FastAPI `status`)
- Anthropic and Supabase clients initialize lazily so the app can boot without optional keys
- `bt-service` uses a FastAPI lifespan hook instead of the deprecated `on_event` startup handler
- Docker image for `bt-service` runs as a non-root user and includes a health check

### Removed

- Unused Python dependencies (`alembic`, `python-jose`) that were not referenced in code
- Empty `packages/*` workspace glob (shared types live in the web app)
